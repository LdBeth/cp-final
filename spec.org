* A simple computer emulator
** COSMAC ELF style
- programming with a switch panel/hex keyboard
- Very small instruction set, no more than 20.
- Has a main memory as a array, a separated display memory, a data stack.
- Produce pixel graphic output via a direct memory access style instruction.
- Produce sound via setting a register controls frequency
- A hex number display
** An assembler script
- Produce json/hex output
- Provide a cheat interface for quick load program
** A hex number helper
** A few demo programs
- calculate Fibonacci 6
- make some noise
- draw some text
- random mini game

* Machine layout
a data stack, a return stack. A P counter, a sound register, a vedio ram,
and a hex display stack, a GOTO register

* Instruction format
 1 byte for all ops
 00 follows a type and data is push data into stack
* Instruction set
- integer arith: plus, minus, times, divide ( n n - n )
- save (n addr - effect) load (addr - effect n) while addr = beg len
- goto ( G - effect ), br0: if stack top 0 then goto ( G - 
- pop ( n - )
